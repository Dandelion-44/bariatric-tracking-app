# Calorie and Weight Tracker (Python, CSV, Jupyter) ðŸ¥—ðŸ“ˆ
This is a personal health tracking project I built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It allows users to log daily weight, calorie intake, and calorie goals. That data 
is then stored in a CSV and is ready for future analysis and visualization
I built this as part of my journey to becoming a data analyst and to support my own wellness and weight loss goals.

## Features
-Automatically logsthe current date
-User input for:
  - Daily weight
  - Calories eaten
  - Target Calories
  - Saves data in a CSV file for long-term tracking
  - Easy to expand with notes, graphs, or summaries

---

## Tools Used
-Python
-Jupyter Notebook
-'csv' module for file writing
-'datetime' for timestamps
-`pandas` for loading data

## Sample Output

Example entry saved in 'tracker.csv':

| Date       | Weight | Calories | Target Calories |

| 2025-07-15 | 466    | 2600     | 2700             |

## Why I Built This

As someone who is personally working toward health and weight loss goals, I wanted to build something personal and meaningful while honing my programming and data analysis skills.

## Future Improvements

- Add a **notes/mood** column
- Visualize **weight trends over time** with `matplotlib`
- Add **summary stats** (e.g., avg weekly calories, total weight lost)
- Build a second version using **Excel or Google Sheets**
- Possibly turn it into a **streamlit dashboard** in the future!

##  How to Run

1. Clone this repo or download `calorie_tracker.ipynb`
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter
3. Run the cells and follow the input prompts
4. Check your folder for the updated `tracker.csv` file
